# text-to-vote
This was a simple web application I wrote for UCLA's Japanese Animated Club which helps us vote on what anime to screen every quarter. Votes are sent via SMS to a phone number provided by Twilio. They are recorded using a MongoDB database, and a vote bar on the client web page is updated in real-time when a vote is received using socket.io events. 

Check out a live version of the site on https://text-to-vote.herokuapp.com/.
